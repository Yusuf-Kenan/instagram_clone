<h1>Insta Clone  </h1>

This app created to understand Flutter. It is a basic app that made me to understand OOP, dart and the class structure. On next project I will try more comlicated structures.

<h2>Screen Emulator</h2>

For screen emulator Flutter_emulator:5554 was used. On next projects hopefully Apple devices will be used. Faker was used to create users, posts and stories.
